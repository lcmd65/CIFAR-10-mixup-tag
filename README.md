This script trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset using PyTorch.

Prerequisites:

    Python 3.6+
    PyTorch
    torchvision
    matplotlib
    
Instructions:

Install dependencies:

Bash
    pip install torch torchvision matplotlib

Run the script:

    Bash
    python script.py

Overview:

Loads and preprocesses the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Defines a CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
Trains the model using Adam optimizer and CrossEntropy loss.
Evaluates and reports test accuracy, with the option to save the best performing model.
Includes functions to visualize predictions on a batch of images and analyze performance per class.
Code Breakdown:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Loads the CIFAR-10 dataset using torchvision.datasets.
Applies data transformations (e.g., ToTensor, normalization) using torchvision.transforms.
Defines batch sizes and data loaders for training and testing.
Network Architecture:
    Defines a CNN architecture with convolutional layers, activation functions (ReLU), pooling layers, and a final fully connected layer.
    Includes BatchNorm layers for regularization.
Training Process:
    Defines Adam optimizer and CrossEntropy loss function.
    Implements a training loop that iterates over batches, calculates loss, updates parameters, and prints progress.
    Saves the model with the highest test accuracy.
Evaluation and Visualization:
    Calculates and reports test accuracy.
    Provides functions to:
    Visualize predictions on a batch of test images.
    Analyze performance per class.
Customization:

    Modify hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs, architecture) to improve performance.
    Explore advanced data augmentation techniques.
    Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Further Enhancements:

    Consider hyperparameter tuning using libraries like Optuna.
    Analyze training behavior with tensorboard pvisualizations.
    Experiment with different architectures and techniques.
